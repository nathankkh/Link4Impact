BT3103 Project: Link4Impact

# Overview
This project was created as part of an NUS module teaching SDLC through a project on web development.

We created a platform for non-profit organisations to list their needs (e.g. manpower for volunteering work; cash funding; asset donation), which allows companies to reach out to non-profit organisations to fulfil their CSR needs. 

## Tech stack used
- Firebase (hosting, storage, cloud functions)
- Vue (using Vite)
